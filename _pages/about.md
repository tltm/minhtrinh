I’m a third-year Mechanical Engineering undergraduate at University College London (UCL), with a minor in Intelligent Systems. My main interests are robotics, reinforcement learning, and quantitative trading, where I enjoy developing adaptive novelty AI systems that connect theory to real-world applications.

Beyond academics, I’m a senior engineer on the [UCL Racing – Mars Rover team](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/engineering/mechanical-engineering/study/beyond-lecture-theatre-student-life-ucl-mechanical-engineering/ucl-racing-uclr), contributing to the Autonomous and Control subteam to design a rover for the European Rover Challenge (ERC). Alongside this, I’m working on an RL-based trading project, where early backtests show improved risk-adjusted returns over baseline strategies. These experiences are helping me strengthen my skills in Python, C++, PyTorch, TensorFlow, HuggingFace, ROS2, and Docker, as well as data analysis with Pandas and scikit-learn.

Looking ahead, I plan to pursue postgraduate study (MSc/PhD) in AI/ML, specialising in reinforcement learning, to deepen my research expertise while continuing to bridge theory with real-world applications.
